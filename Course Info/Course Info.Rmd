# Review Session

- We will have weekly review sessions.

- Each review session consists of two halves: 

    - The first half will be a mini-lecture on supplementary materials and topics of interest. In-class experiments will also be conducted during which you will play games that mimic real economic settings, such as [trading in competitive markets](https://www.moblab.com/edu/games/competitive-market-continuous-double-auction). The goal is to facilitate learning and encourage you to think on a deeper level how economic theory works or fails to work in practice.
    
    - The second half will be a Q&A session on course materials and homework problems.
    
- Review sessions are an important extension of our class. Attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. You will also have the opportunity to earn bonus credits.

# Homework

- Homework assignments are submitted on [SPOC](http://l.xmu.edu.cn).

- You are encouraged to discuss homework with your classmates, but must prepare yours *individually*.

- Economics is an empirical science. Even though this is an introductory course, we will be conducting some hands-on data analysis in our homework to help us apply and better understand the principles and theories we learn in class.

- We will be using a statistical computing language called `R`. See [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/principles-of-economics/Software/) for an introduction and helpful resources.

- It is recommended that you write your homework in `LaTeX` or `markdown`. When we do data analysis, it is _mandatory_ that you write your homework in `R markdown`, which allows you to embed `R` codes in the homework and automatically generate their output.

# Recommended Readings

- In addition to classroom learning, it is important that you culitvate the habit of reading and following economic and financial news.

  - Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Financial Times (FT), Bloomberg, The Economist, ...
  
- For more in-depth reading, I also recommend publications such as the Journal of Economic Perspectives, where economists publish non-technical articles on various topics in economics and finance.

- See [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/principles-of-economics/Links) for a list of these and other recommended readings.
