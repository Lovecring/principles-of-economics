# Git Basics
#### by [Gao Qinghui](https://github.com/gaoqinghui/)
The recommendation for this course is to fork the repo, don't make any changes unless you're familar with git, and regularly synchronize the repo to update the course material.

## Introduction
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system (controlling file or project version) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

In this course, we will be using Git mainly for downloading and updating course materials (We will use moodle to upload homework).
